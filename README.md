# Steven Straatemans MediaMonks test
Thank you for taking a look at my result of the MediaMonks test.  
It was the purpose of this test to recreate the Flash website `http://devmonks.vellance.net/p/path/` to a working HTML5 website, without the use of third-party libraries.

I tried to create the website with HTML + CSS only.  
Only for the pre-loader, some Javascript was needed.
When you disable javascript in the browser, the pre-loader animation will play once and then show you the working website.
Please follow the instructions below to build the website.

## installation instructions
Please follow the instructions below to build the website.  
For the build you need NPM, Gulp and typings installed globally.

Clone this repo
```
https://github.com/sstraatemans/mediamonks.git
```
Install the Npm dependencies
```
$ npm i
```
run Gulp in a new window and keep it running
```
$ gulp
```
Now you can open the website on `http://localhost:4500`

Enjoy!
